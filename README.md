# Vera Rubin Observatory — Astronomy Rubin Science Platform Toolkit

Welcome! This repository is a shared space for our data science work from May 2025 - July 2025 using the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) Rubin Science Platform (RSP). It contains our team's exploratory notebooks, query templates, and beginner-friendly guides for working with LSST data, especially for interdisciplinary researchers and students from non-CS backgrounds.
