# Vera Rubin Observatory — Astronomy Rubin Science Platform Toolkit

Welcome! This repository is a shared space for our data science work from May 2025 - July 2025 using the [Vera C. Rubin Observatory](https://www.lsst.org/) Rubin Science Platform (RSP). It contains our team's exploratory notebooks, query templates, and beginner-friendly guides for working with LSST data, especially for interdisciplinary researchers and students from non-CS backgrounds.

## Project Overview

We are a student team at California State University exploring and analyzing **Pulsating Stars** from Rubin’s datasets. Our goals include:

- Identifying variable stars and their types using catalogs and variability statistics
- Classifying stars using color and periodicity
- Measuring periods from light curves
- Applying P-L relations to estimate distances
- Mapping star positions in 3D Galactic coordinates (RA/DEC) using Astropy
